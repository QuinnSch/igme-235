        <p id = "aboutme">
            Ever since I was young, I've had an interest in video games. They've inspired me to make art (which is the skill I've put the most time into) and music, and to eventually enroll in the Game Design and Development program here at RIT. I'm hoping to learn from this class the web design skills I'll need to set up a page for a game of my own when that day comes. I'm looking forward to my future at this school, wherever it's taken me by the time I graduate.
